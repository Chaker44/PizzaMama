# PizzaMama
My First Django App it's a simple app that lists a pizzas menu  : 
Url of the app: https://pizzamama484.herokuapp.com/   
=> You can notice that the application is not responsive I created it just to 
learn how to deploy a web app in Heroku and learn how to create a web app using the MVT (models, views, and templates) design pattern
 that Django follows to develop web applications.
