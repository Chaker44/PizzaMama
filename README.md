# PizzaMama
My First Django App it's a simple app that lists a pizzas menu  : 
Url of the app: https://pizzamama484.herokuapp.com/  
=> You can notice that the application is not responsive I did it just to learn how to deploy a web app in Heroku and learn
 the basics of the Django framework like models, views, and URLs manipulation.
